# What is this app ?

## This is a video sharing app.
## This app can be used to upload a video and share it with the public.

# How is it created ?

- This app is created with react typescript.

- For the database, I have used firebase. For login & signup, I have used firebse authentication an user can sign up for this application with an email and a password. The video and the thumbnail can be uploaded in any format. For storing the images and videos here, firebase storage is used. For generating the unique id for each video, this application generates a unique uuid by the current timestamp.

- I have used some important npm packages here :

1. miui: This package is used here to style the webpage.

2. react-toastify : This package is used here to send notifications to the users.

3. firebase : This is used to take the api of firebase.
